        "startupPitch": "We have the sector, we have selected the transport and logistics, and the nation is going to be in KSA. The disruption pattern is potentiality mapping, and then the business model is vertical integration, and the team archetype is operational excellence, and now, just to give you an idea of the concept, it's an AI extension tool meant to oversee the whole logistics processes and to optimize the process and give solutions for future on how to optimize that process. For example, back in Saudi, they used to ask me, like, where's the location of the house? And it might take one to two days, so it's a bit vague, although the DHL and FedEx are really good, but not as much as good as it should be. So that tool is going to be overseeing the whole process from the origin until the shipment is in your door. So it's meant to be meant for business-to-business, for the logistics companies, the fact that those companies could be extended to see multiple companies in the future, not only logistics, and could be applied as an extension of different kind of processes. And it's aligned as well with the Vision 2030, which is the goals in logistics transformation. The name of our startup is The package."
